# 🔍 Crime Prediction and Analysis System

## 📌 Overview
Developed a machine learning–based crime prediction and analysis system to forecast future crime trends using regression-based models and socio-economic features derived from historical crime data.

Built an interactive Streamlit web application with dynamic crime hotspot maps that update based on the selected year, crime type, and predicted values, enabling intuitive visual analysis of crime patterns and high-risk areas.
